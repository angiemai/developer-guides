# Visual Developer Guides

A collection of guides aimed at developer tools that are commonly used.  

The guides include quick starts which help someone understand the essence of using a developer tool, such as a Git quickstart that demonstrates all the basic commands.

The collection also contains visualisations of workflows in which tools are used.  For example using Git and Github, collaborative deployment on Heroku or understanding how Heroku works behind the scenes.

# How the guides are created
The developer guides are created with [http://inkscape.org/](Inkscape) 

Pdf documents and images can be exported from Inkscape for distribution digitally or for printing.

Pull request welcome along with any suggestions of other guides.

Thank you
